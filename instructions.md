# Distributed Systems Assignment: Private Cloud Whiteboard Application

You have to design and document the architecture of a private cloud, implement it, and then
deploy on it a whiteboard application. The whiteboard application should run on at least two
separate machines/nodes within your private cloud, with each applicationâ€™s instance serving
a different group of users. You should demonstrate that the distributed application running in
your private cloud is consistent in a way that all users will see the same application state
across different instances. The cloud and application should scale to support additional users,
and offer an improved quality of service when compared to one running on a single machine.
The assignment is separated into a set of tasks, and there is a set of activities that should be
undertaken for each task.
You are not restricted to a particular set of tools or technologies, but you must justify your
choices when designing and implementing your architecture. You should critically assess your
options before you propose your architecture and carefully evaluate the tools and technologies
to implement your architectur

## Assignment Brief
Design, document, and implement a private cloud architecture to deploy a distributed whiteboard application. The application should:
- Run on multiple nodes within your private cloud
- Serve different user groups across instances
- Maintain consistency across all instances
- Scale to support additional users
- Provide improved quality of service compared to single-machine deployment
